# Hackathon 2 - Twitch Buddy

This was a 2-day Hackathon project that combined different data sources into an application or game

### Description 
- In the course of 2-days, 3 other teammates and I combined at least 4 **external** resources via AJAX requests and presented their information in an application we called, Twitch Buddy. We utilized 4 APIS from different games such as FortNite, Dota2, Black OPS 4, and BattleField 1 and used a Twitch API to showcase each player's live game and their statistics.   

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
