# Hackathon 2 - Twitch Buddy

This was a 2-day Hackathon project that combined different data sources into an application or game

### Description 
- In the course of 2-days, 3 other teammates and I combined at least 4 **external** resources via AJAX requests and presented their information in an application we called, Twitch Buddy. We utilized 4 APIS from different games such as FortNite, Dota2, Black OPS 4, and BattleField 1 and used a Twitch API to showcase each player's live game and their statistics.   

### Judging Criteria
- **Appeal** : is it visually appealing / well put together
- **Code Quality** : is the code properly formatted, are variables and functions well defined and documented
- **Presentation** : How well is it presented during the unveiling session
- **Task / Issue Management** : How well was the development process documented / controlled.  Were there well-defined issues, milestones, and project management
- **Innovative / Transformative** : Did the project do something new and exciting?  Was it bold and tried to do things that haven't been done much.  Did it combine the data sources together in a way that was more useful than either source by itself
- **Ease of Use / Understanding** : Was it easy to use the application / game, or if it was more complex, was the application or game able to provide you with tutorials or instructions that made understanding it a breeze.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
